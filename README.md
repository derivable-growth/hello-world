# hello-world
Everything has its own beggining and the end. Let's start the journey!

Hello, world! I'm new to this GitHub popular for 'all kinds of' developers one big project website.
I hope it is possible to improve my skills (overall) from being here and sharing with other people of what I shyly call 'a development of my projects'. 

What I'm up to work with:
1. Vim. Oh, it was so easy to enter this world of 'YOU DON'T NEED A MOUSE TO WRITE A CODE'. Now it's time to dive into features of that wonderful text editor.
2. Web-programming (HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js etc): I'm not sure whether I become front-end/back-end/fullstack/any_of_these web developer or not, but it's a good practice anyway to understand what's going on when I go to the browser. Internet rocks, as people are used to say. So you have to keep in touch with it.
3. Software development/Programming languages (Java, C++, Python etc): it's good to know how to write a code to build a webpage, deploy you own web-site, support your own web-server. But it is just not enough for me to believe I'm a good programmer if I don't understand:
a) how to do it from scratch, little by little, step by step;
b) how it actually works "behind the scenes";
c) how to make something useful on my own.

It's a long way to go, but I hope I'll be satisfied when I'm at the end of the road.
